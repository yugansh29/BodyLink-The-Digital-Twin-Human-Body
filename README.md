# Body_Link-The-Digital-Twin-Human-Body
The purpose of this study is to develop a digital twin of the human body that utilizes basic sensors to visualize the status of various organs in real-time. The research aims to address the problem of providing a continuous, non-invasive, and cost-effective method for monitoring the health status of individuals.

Technical Documentation for Digital Twin of Human Body

1. System Architecture and Design
The system architecture is designed to integrate multiple components into a cohesive platform that enables real-time monitoring and simulation of the human body’s health status. It consists of three main layers:
Wearable Device Layer: Collects real-time physiological data from the user using a variety of sensors (ECG, PPG, temperature, pulse oximeter, bioimpedance sensors).
Data Processing Layer: Handles data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning-based predictions.
Digital Twin Platform Layer: Stores, processes, and analyzes data to simulate the health status of the user in real-time. The platform features a health monitoring dashboard and an alert system, pushing analyzed results to the relevant stakeholders.
Key Technologies:
Data Transmission Protocol: MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
Cloud Service: Vultr Cloud Service for data storage and processing
Machine Learning Models: Used for health anomaly detection and predictions
Connectivity: WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity modules
Data Flow:
Wearable device sensors collect data (ECG, heart rate, temperature, etc.).
Data is sent via MQTT over WiFi/Bluetooth to the Cloud.
Vultr Cloud Service processes the data, applying machine learning models for real-time analysis.
Results are sent back to the user's application or dashboard, and alerts are generated when anomalies are detected.

2. Explanation of Key Components and Modules
Wearable Device Components:
ECG Sensor: Measures the electrical activity of the heart.

Microcontroller (ESP32): Responsible for managing sensor data and controlling communication protocols.
Connectivity Module (WiFi/Bluetooth): Transfers collected sensor data to the cloud for analysis via MQTT.
Data Processing Layer:
Data Acquisition: Captures the raw data from the sensors.
Preprocessing: Normalizes and cleanses the data.
Feature Extraction: Extracts key features like heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen saturation.
Machine Learning Module: Predicts potential health issues based on historical and real-time data.
Digital Twin Simulation: Simulates the real-time state of the body based on the input from the wearable device.
Digital Twin Platform:
Database: Stores both historical and real-time data collected from the wearable.
Real-Time Analytics Engine: Provides live analysis of the incoming data stream.
Health Monitoring Dashboard: Visualizes the body’s health status.
