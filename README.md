# Body_Link-The-Digital-Twin-Human-Body
The purpose of this study is to develop a digital twin of the human body that utilizes basic sensors to visualize the status of various organs in real-time. The research aims to address the problem of providing a continuous, non-invasive, and cost-effective method for monitoring the health status of individuals.

# Digital Twin of Human Body
## Running the Web Application

To start the web application:

1. Navigate into the `Web-App` directory:
   ```bash
   cd Web-App
2. Run
   ```bash
   node server.js
   
## System Architecture and Design

The system architecture is designed to integrate multiple components into a cohesive platform that enables real-time monitoring and simulation of the human body’s health status. It consists of three main layers:

- **Wearable Device Layer**: Collects real-time physiological data from the user using a variety of sensors (ECG, PPG, temperature, pulse oximeter, bioimpedance sensors).
- **Data Processing Layer**: Handles data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning-based predictions.
- **Digital Twin Platform Layer**: Stores, processes, and analyzes data to simulate the health status of the user in real-time. The platform features a health monitoring dashboard and an alert system, pushing analyzed results to the relevant stakeholders.

### Key Technologies:
- **Data Transmission Protocol**: MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
- **Cloud Service**: Vultr Cloud Service for data storage and processing
- **Machine Learning Models**: Used for health anomaly detection and predictions
- **Connectivity**: WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity modules

### Data Flow:
1. Wearable device sensors collect data (ECG, heart rate, temperature, etc.).
2. Data is sent via MQTT over WiFi/Bluetooth to the Cloud.
3. Vultr Cloud Service processes the data, applying machine learning models for real-time analysis.
4. Results are sent back to the user's application or dashboard, and alerts are generated when anomalies are detected.
