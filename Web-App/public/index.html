            <h3>Insights</h3>
            <p>
              Stable Health Metrics “All parameters are within the healthy
              range. No immediate concerns.” “Your resting heart rate and blood
              oxygen levels are consistent with your baseline. Keep maintaining
              a balanced lifestyle.” Improvement in Vital Signs “Slight
              improvement in ECG variability, indicating better cardiovascular
              health.” “Increased SpO2 levels detected. Recent activity may have
              positively impacted oxygenation.” Trends Over Time “Heart rate
              variability has improved by 5% over the past month, indicating
              potential stress reduction.” “SpO2 levels are consistently high,
              suggesting optimal lung function.”

            <h3>Suggestions</h3>
            <p>
              Lifestyle Adjustments “Increased heart rate variability suggests
              moderate stress levels. Practicing deep breathing exercises or
              taking a short walk may help.” “Body temperature is slightly
              elevated. Avoid heavy exercise in the next hour and stay
              hydrated.” Sleep and Recovery Tips “SpO2 levels indicate potential
              mild hypoxia during sleep. Consider changing sleep posture or
              using a humidifier.” “Heart rate trends suggest potential
              overtraining. Allow for more rest to support cardiovascular
              recovery.” Preventive Health Measures “ECG analysis suggests
              slight irregularities. Scheduling a checkup could provide
              additional insights into heart health.” “Lower-than-average SpO2
              readings may benefit from gentle breathing exercises to boost
              oxygen levels.”

            <h3>Warnings</h3>
            <p>
              Elevated Heart Rate “Your heart rate has been elevated above your
              usual resting rate for the past hour. Consider taking a break or
              practicing relaxation techniques.” Low SpO2 Levels “SpO2 levels
              have dipped below 92% for more than 5 minutes. Monitor any signs
              of breathlessness or dizziness.” Increased Body Temperature “Body
              temperature has been slightly elevated. Hydrate and rest. If this
              continues, consider monitoring for signs of fever.” ECG
              Irregularities “Minor irregularities detected in your ECG
              patterns. This could indicate mild stress or physical exertion.
              Monitor for any unusual symptoms.”
